        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        Emergency In Section C is a game created for the May Day Make-A-Level Game Jam on itch.io, with the main theme being Emergency. <br><br>
        In the game, you play as an astronaut who has to escape the impending destruction of a space station by traversing its complex hallways, and make your way back to safety. <br><br>
        Through this project, I wanted to challenge my skills in order to create an immersive platformer that allowed for player exploration whilst adhereing to the game jam's theme of "Emergency".

      <h2>Gameplay Design Process</h2>

      In designing gameplay, I first considered how to create a high tension environment in order to match the theme of the game. Based off our narrative direction for the game, we decided to move forward in using limited oxygen as a timer to drive the core tension for the game, with checkpoints and other minor pickups that restore the player's oxygen. <br><br>
      From there, I then decided to add extra forms of oxygen depletion depending on the player's movement (fixed depletion while jumping, running depletes more than standing) in order to create the additional tension of the player having to be efficient with their movement. <br><br>

        <figcaption>Gameplay screenshot demonstrating a moving platform and the player having low oxygen.</figcaption>
      </div>

      <h2>Level Design Process</h2>

      My main approach with the level design for this game is to facilitate the freedom of movement in order to drive the tension under the theme of emergency. As a result of this, I chose to implement alternating platforms into the level design to allow for more pathing options in a smaller space, allowing the player to explore different paths while retaining the core tension derived from the gameplay design.<br><br>
      Due to the single-level format of this game jam, I seperated the level into modules when designing in order to better define gameplay beats and to better control the purpose of each individual module. The earlier modules introduced level mechanics and setting up expectations for how these mechanics will be used later on in the level, while the later modules focused on challenging the player's execution and testing their understanding of the level mechanics.

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      Overall, this project served to be a fun challenge in game design, and not only did I learn how to develop a game in a more collaborative manner, I also learned a lot about how level design and gameplay design can interact in order to create unique experiences for a game.
