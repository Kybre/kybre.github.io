        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        Monkey Mobius is a game created for the 2021 BC Game Jam under the theme of "Infinite", inspired by mind-bending, space-defying puzzle games. The game went on to win the Participant's Choice award for the event.<br><br>
        In the game, you play as Caesar the Monkey, who has to traverse an endless tropical maze in his quest to reach the Banana Temple and deliver sacrificial bananas to the Banana Overlord. <br><br>
        Through this project, my main objective was to take the learnings of previous game jams and consolidate my design processes.

      <h2>Gameplay Design Process</h2>

      At the beginning of the jam, me and my team discussed how to dissect the definition of the word "Infinite", and how to convey those definitions to a player. From there, we decided to convert our interpretation of the theme into the core mechanic of infinite space. <br><br>
      In order to create the illusion of an infinite space, portals were used to seamlessly transport the player from one side of the map to another, with duplicate level and box visuals to help sell the illusion. In addition, I opted to use a seamless transition between levels to make the levels feel like one interconnected space, even as the player went from one level to the next. <br><br>

      <h2>Level Design Process</h2>

      My main approach with the level design for this game was to take the player's established concept of space, and turn that understanding on its head as the player progressed through the levels. As a result of this, levels were designed such that spaces and level elements were added on top of each other as part of a growing space, where the end of one level was the start of another. <br><br>
      In light of the space-bending concept of the game, levels were also designed such that the player would understand where to go, framing the journey between start and finish as the main challenge.

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      Through the course of this project, I was able to reflect on the shortcomings in previous game jams and streamline my design process, which resulted in the success of winning the Participant's Choice award in the event. <br><br>
      Being able to test my skills in gameplay and level design when space is not as it seems was also a very valuable experience. In addition to a better understanding of working around spatial limitations, I also learned more about how the player's experience can be controlled through the presentation of gameplay.
