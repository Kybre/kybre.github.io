        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        The Kalmont Mountain Safety and Rescue Team (KMSRT) Website is an informational website designed and developed as part of the class IAT 235: Information Design. <br><br>
        The KMSRT Website contains tips on conquering the winter outdoors as well as regional news and info, all contained in a responsive website designed for use on any device. <br><br>
        Through this project, I wanted to learn more about web design and how information can be structured for ease of access and formatted for readability.

          <figcaption>Sample screenshot of Hypothermia page. Graphics made by Taylor Liu.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        The KMSRT Website consists of 3 larger articles containing information on how to deal with avalanches, hypothermia, and mountain safety. <br><br>
        The website also contains fictional news articles detailing the current happenings in the fictional region, as well as a fictional page introducing the team and its history.

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        During the planning process, each of us created draft mockups to visualize how we would individually design a website like this. We then combined different elements of our drafts to create the groupâ€™s collective draft for the website. Initially, I designed my mockups while prioritizing readability and ease of access, and tried to choose colours that represented both the rescue aspect of the organization in a light red, as well as the winter outdoors, with a light gray close to white and a light blue. <br> <br>
        Ultimately, however, the group opted for a mix between mostly Taylor and Jonathan's designs for the site, as Taylor's colour pallete and content sectioning were the most eye-pleasing and Jonathan's drafts had interesting layouts and stylistic elements that provided a unique style to the website.

        </div>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        In creating this website, I was able to learn the basics of web development and design, and how to structure content in a website for informational purposes. Using these newfound skills, I hope to further hone my skills in web design and development to create websites for a variety of different purposes.
